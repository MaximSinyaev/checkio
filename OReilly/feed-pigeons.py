# I start to feed one of the pigeons.    A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3.    Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute,    but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first.    Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop.    If I haveNportions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?
# 
# 
# 
# Input:A quantity of portions wheat as a positive integer.
# 
# Output:The number of fed pigeons as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:0 < N < 105.
